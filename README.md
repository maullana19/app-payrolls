## About

App payrolls is a system or program regarding payroll and recording employee records in a company called PT Unggul Cipta, this system studies how the salary of an employee can increase efficiency in the process and is good and fair.

This system is also part of the results of my study on the title of the thesis I made.

I also understand that there are still many problems, bugs and system errors in this application so that further development is still needed, if you are willing to help, you can contact me.
